Beyond Jupyter Widgets with JavaScript
======================================

Sometimes you want or you are asked to create an interactive notebook with a lot of fancy and cool stuff. There are a lot of options for you to implement these, specially using ipywidgets. However, there are times when you require some functionality that your code in python is not ready to give you straight away.

This is when resorting to JavaScript can be the solution. For example, you want to change the headers' colour of your interactive table or you want to insert a cell code in some part of your notebook. By accessing the IPython Api or by using css styling options we can achieve almost everything we might need to give our interactive notebooks the final touch!

Here we will see a few examples where we will implement some of these ideas step by step. Hope this will help anyone to understand how we can leverage JS code in jupyter notebooks to go beyond the available options.
